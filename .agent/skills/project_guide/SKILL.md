# Project Guide Skill

This skill helps the agent understand the structure and purpose of the `ANTI` project.

## Instructions
When the user asks about the project or asks for help with a new feature, always refer to the following structure:
- `backend/`: C# / .NET Core backend API.
- `frontend/`: Vue.js or similar frontend application.
- `docs/`: Project documentation (if any).

## Guidelines
- Always prioritize clear, clean code in both frontend and backend.
- Ensure API endpoints match the frontend expectations.
- If the user asks for a summary, mention that this project is a "Dialysis System" (透析系統) based on previous context.
